A JavaFX GUI card game based on the ever popular game Hi or Lo

HiLo is a card where a card is dealt and the player has to guess whether the next card that is dealt will be
higher or lower that the first card.
If the card dealt is in accordance with the guess of the user then the user wins.
Note that for the purposes of comparing cards, only the face of the card matters.
