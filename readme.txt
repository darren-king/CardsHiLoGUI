A JavaFX GUI card game based on the ever popular card game Hi or Lo.

HOW TO PLAY:

Select New Game from the File drop down menu.
This will start a new game with a new deck of 52 shuffled cards.

You then click the 'Deal First Card' button to start the game.
The first card on the left will be turned over.

You then have to decide if the next card dealt - the card on the right - will be higher or lower than the first card.
To do this you click either the Higher or Lower radio button followed by the 'Deal Second Card' button.
(Note: The value or rank of the card is all that matters - all suits are treated  the same).

If you guess correctly that's one point for you and you start again by dealing the card on the left.

In order to win you have to make 5 consecutive correct guesses before the deck of cards runs out.

If you guess incorrectly your score goes back to zero. And if you don't get 5 consecutive correct guesses before the
cards run out, you lose.

Good luck. And may the odds be ever  in  your favour.
